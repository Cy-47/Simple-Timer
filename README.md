# Simple-Timer

For some ﻿reason, macOS doesn't have a built-in timer. And I couldn't find any software with the function of a stopwatch. (But isn't this easy to develop🤔???) So I created this simple timer. Currently, it's just a stopwatch.

不知为何MacOS上没有任何计时器，我也找不到任何有秒表功能的软件（但是这不是写起来很简单嘛🤔。。。）。所以我就写了一个。目前它仅有秒表功能。
